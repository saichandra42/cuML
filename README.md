# PyTorch-Logistic
Logistic regression implementation with optimization in AWS Sagemaker.

- [x] Create initial model for PyTorch Linear Regression
- [ ] Model training/testing error difference is huge, is the model overfitting?
- [x] Did the model overfit for 1 training example? Sanity check
- [ ] Tensorboard API to create versions of the models.
- [ ] Clean up the code and use parallel processing to fasten the training process
- [ ] Overfitting/underfitting issue.
- [ ] Model loss is 0 and 100 alternatively
- [ ] Model weights and bias are not updating. Gradient vanish issue is present
