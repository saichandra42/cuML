# KNN using scikit-learn
KNN Classification implementation with optimization in AWS Sagemaker.

- [ ] Distances from each image to all the other images are plotted
- [ ] In the original dataset, from the distance hist, it can be found that,the distances are huge between points
- [ ] There are hardly few points with near distances, KNN might be severly effected
